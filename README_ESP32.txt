ESP32 Custom PCB Design in KiCad
Overview
This repository contains a custom PCB design for the ESP32 microcontroller created using KiCad. The project serves as a learning experience to better understand PCB design and the ESP32 IO Architecture. The design includes components such as the AMS1117-3.3 voltage regulator, decoupling capacitors, BOOT/RST buttons, a USB-C port, and a GPIO header.

Components Breakdown
1Ô∏è‚É£ ESP32 Microcontroller

Execution Flow
Schematic Design:

The components were carefully selected based on the ESP32 IO Architecture and basic design principles.

PCB Layout:

In KiCad, I designed the PCB with proper routing for power, ground, and signal lines, ensuring optimal performance and stability.

Testing & Assembly:

Although this project has not been physically assembled yet, the design is intended to be easily manufacturable and functional.

How to Use
Open the project in KiCad to inspect the schematic and layout.

Export the Gerber files and order the PCB for manufacturing.

Follow the provided design for assembly, with a focus on proper soldering and component placement.
